# NVDA add-on with app module for LUWRAIN Application

Add-on with App module that automatically enable NVDA sleep mode in a window of LUWRAIN self-voicing application.

## Package contents

* addon: Directory of the add-on source code.
* build.py: The add-on build script file (the add-on is builded as the luwrain.nvda-addon file in the same directory).
* README.md: This file.

## Notes

There is a [recommended template](https://github.com/nvdaaddons/AddonTemplate/) for development, building, distribution and localization NVDA add-ons. However, this template was considered over-engineering for this small add-on, so a simple script build.py is used.

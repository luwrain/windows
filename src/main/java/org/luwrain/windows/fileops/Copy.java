/**
 * Implementation of the files copying procedure. To make its behaviour
 * more predictable, impose three simple rules, which this algorithm must
 * always follow:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only regular files may be overwritten if they are exist</li>
 * <li>Symlinks are always copied as symlinks (their copying never led to
 * creating of regular files or directories)</li>
 * <li>Files of other types than regular files, directories or symlinks are
 * silently skipped</li>
 * <li>Source files may not be given by relative pathes</li>
 * <li>If the destination is given by a relative pathe, the parent of the first source used to resolve it</li>
 * </ul>
